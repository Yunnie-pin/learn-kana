# Learn-Kana

![Deployment Status](https://github.com/Eldoprano/learn-kana/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

This website is still under occasional development~
You can check how it looks so far here:
- [GitHub pages](https://eldoprano.github.io/learn-kana/)
- [Cloudflare pages](https://learn-kana.pages.dev/)

A website where you will be shoved Kana characters up to your brain, until you get them all.

## Ideas to implement
- User can choose which Kana groups to practice on. ✅
- A beginner mode that slowly includes more characters into the mix. ❔
- User progress and settings should be saved locally. ✅ (Maybe online in the future...)
- The practicing page will consist of:
  - A minimalistic page showing the current Kana, or group of Kanas. ✅
  - Users keyboard input will be showed below. Or buttons with possible answers. ✅
  - User score will be showned in a corner. ✅
  - The background color will react according to the speed and correctness of the users answer (timed combos?). ☢️
  - A help window will also be available, showing Kanas with their romanjis, together with similar Kanas. ❔
  - Show Kana progress per character. This can be adjusted. ⚠️
  - Meaning of word should be more readable. ⚠️
  - More words for the first groups (and in general). ⚠️
  - When user decides to stop practicing (Or if a timer was set and finished) the user will be showed statistics:
    - How many Kanas you got. ✅
    - Kanas you have difficulties with (based on incorrect answers and... time?). ⚠️
    - Average response time (ignores large time pauses). ✅

## Privacy & Analytics

This website uses [Umami](https://umami.is/), a privacy-focused, open-source analytics solution. It collects anonymous data to help me understand how the site is used and improve it. No personal data is collected, and cookies are not used for tracking.
## Running with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then set APP_PORT to the port you want
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>` (default `8080`). To change the port, edit `APP_PORT` in `.env` and run `docker compose up -d` again. You can also set it for a single run: `APP_PORT=3000 docker compose up -d`.
